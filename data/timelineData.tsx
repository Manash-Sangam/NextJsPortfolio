        <p>
        During my final year of engineering, I embarked on an exciting freelancing journey, collaborating with diverse clients and tackling projects across various domains. I developed robust MERN applications, implemented CI/CD pipelines, containerized applications, and deployed them seamlessly to GCP and AWS, honing my expertise in REST APIs, Docker, cloud technologies, and DevOps practices. Additionally, I built a powerful web scraper API using Flask and Python, showcasing my ability to create scalable and efficient solutions. My passion for innovation extended to IoT, where I contributed to a smart farming project by leveraging skills in C++, Arduino programming, and hardware integration. This period was pivotal in shaping my technical acumen and problem-solving capabilities.
